MissingOutputException in rule cluster_detection in file /home/operon/scripts/dugway/workflow/Snakefile, line 31:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/embeddings/umap_embedding_5d_clusters.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
